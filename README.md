# CodingProjects
Coding projects I have worked on this past year. The first project is a graphics project in which I chose to have stick figure men do the YMCA dance.
This project took around 3-4 days to complete, working for around 2-3 hours a day. I mostly worked alone on my projects, but on this one I worked with 
two other students. The second project is an infographic, where one can enter an entire paper, book, or movie script and get some small details on it.
This project I mostly worked on by myself, and was my favorite project I worked on. I chose these two projects because they were one of the toughest and 
also fun prjoects that I worked on this past year.
